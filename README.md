# Coin Quest
My first full stack application in JavaScript and Firebase built completely from scratch. This app allows users to create budgets, and allows them to set goals with their money, as well as projects for longer term plans. The finances are displayed as an interactive doughnut chart and all data is autosynced across the application. The application adds a gamified layer to finance by allowing users to level up and earn coins to buy custom characters as they hit their financial goals. A dark mode and a custom cursor are also included.
